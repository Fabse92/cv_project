\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{FBE} was fastest to explore the environment
	\item \texttt{SBE (obs)} had best overall performance, with recall of 0.75 and precision of 0.25 after 25 views
	\item \texttt{FBE plus} implemented to combine the best of these two methods
	\item \texttt{SBE (obs+cands)} failed to improve on the performance of \texttt{SBE (obs)}; presumably because precision of detections too low for extra candidate information to improve performance
\end{itemize}
