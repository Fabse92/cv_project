\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pioneer 2 robot moves around the environment and provides odometry information (red).
	\item Mounted Kinect camera provides RGB images, depth maps, and point clouds (light blue).
	\item Point cloud is transformed to laserscan (yellow) and combined with odometry data to perform SLAM (green).
	\item 2D object candidates are detected from the RGB image using the VOCUS2 saliency system\cite{garcia2013computational} and projected into a 3D octomap\cite{hornung13octomap} using the depth values. Overlapping candidates are merged into coherent single entities (brown).
	\item Map of the environment, estimated robot pose and object candidates are used to calculate the next best view pose (purple).
	\item The NBV to move to is sent to the navigation system (dark blue) which calculates a path and provides motor instructions to the Pioneer.
	\item System framework and inter-module communication implemented using ROS
