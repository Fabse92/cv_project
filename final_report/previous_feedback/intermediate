Hi Phil and Jan,

Thank you for the report, we have read it and here's the feedback.

In general, the content, writing style is good. The system overview
figure is very helpful and we are also happy with the thorough plans for
next steps. Overall we think you guys did a good job with the report,
thanks for the effort.

Regarding the possible improvements, here are some general comments, and
more details you can find in the attachment.

1. It is very important for the readers to fully understand the problem
you want to address in the project. Structural wise it would be better
to have section 1.1 as an individual section 2. And provide more details
for all the scenarios, e.g. some figures illustrating the different
scenarios would make your problem much clearer for the readers.

2. In section 1.2 related work, you mixed the content with you gonna do
with your system (I marked them in the attachment), and those parts
should be in later section when you actually start to describe your system.

3. It is useful to use some automated spell checker or grammar checking
tool.

Other details are included in the attachment. Feel free to let us know
if any of comments is not clear or confusing.

We don't need a revision for this report, the feedback should be taken
into account when you are preparing for the final report.

Best,

Ge and Mikko
