Hi,

we have read your project plans. We will give detailed comments to each
group separately beginning of next week. However, here are some general
comments that we found to apply to everyone. Think about these issues
before your presentation next week and present answers as they apply to
your project.

1: What are the risks involved in your project? For example, is there a
specific part that is critical for your success? If this cannot be
achieved, do you have a backup plan, and what is it?

2: Define at least one *concrete* scenario or test case for your
project. Describe what are the inputs (types of images, other
information?), and what is the scenario or setup of the environment. You
should have enough detail in this description that when you encounter a
question during your project such as "should we do A or B", recalling
the scenario you are targeting will help you decide what is most
appropriate. Additionally, the scenario will give you a clear goal to
strive for in your project.

Prepare to give a 15 minute presentation about your project topic and plan.


Best,

Mikko & Ge
