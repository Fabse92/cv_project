\section{Introduction}
%Introduction, which describes the motivation and goal of your project. Describe how your project is connected to existing literature. Include references to scientific papers that are relevant to your topic. Do not copy your text from the intermediate report. Revise and rewrite according to the feedback you got and what the actual outcome of the project was.

In this final report of our project, we want to present our system, how it works, how it changed during the development, and how it performs.
The goal we had for our project was to develop an autonomous robot that is able to find areas corresponding to objects in its environment.
For autonomous systems in the future it is desirable that they are able to solve everyday life tasks of humans.
Since almost every meaningful everyday life task of humans contains interaction with at least some object of the environment, it is important that robots are able to find and use objects.
One of the first steps for this is object detection, which allows the robot to filter out relevant parts of its environment which are likely to correspond to an actual object. Having a model of nearby object positions and shapes could then allow the robot to go through this internal list and search for an object that might help him for his current task.
When a robot is visiting a place for the first time it might be a good idea to explore this room to create such a list of available objects.
This is the situation and the task that we want to solve with our system.
To be able to do this, it is necessary to perform simultaneous localization and mapping, detect potential objects in the current view, and to compute the next best view which allows to explore the environment
