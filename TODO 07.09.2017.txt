TODO 07.09.2017

Needed for first tests:

PHIL:
Compare ground truth to proposals service
  - Create point cloud from specific octomap candidate
  - Create pcl::ConcaveHull objects from ground truth and candidate to get volumes
  - Apply a pcl::ConcaveHull::CropHull filter to the candidate PC, using the ground truth hull as the filter
  - Create a concave (convex?) hull from the filtered point cloud to get the intersection volume





Needed for subsequent tests:

Horizontal occupancy grid from octomap
Extra information gain method(s)
  - Currently: scored based on known vs. unknown space with bonus for unknown space near objects
  - Possible: additionally take into account label certainty
    - New octomap_server service: takes current gMapping occupancy grid (cost map), for each pixel of cost map get (x,y) co-ord, get this (x,y,z) co-ord from octomap, and if there is an object use setCost in the costmap to set the cost to the weight and return the updated map (costmap_2d package)
    - provide certainty for each object candidate voxel on ground level
    - Extension: iterate up the z axis and do some kind of average or something






General improvements:

Primary:

Frames: see if we can't get the octomap in the odom frame so that it updates when the map updates
  - BUT: odom is a non-fixed frame, while the octomap is fixed.


Secondary

Save and load octomap

Fix the error in the explore server which makes the robot stop moving for no apparent reason
  - Result from meeting: Increase footprint of the robot as defined in move_base
  
Implement service to ask if area is part of a wall (a very large object)

Depth saliency - investigate
  - Result from meeting: low priority
  
Increase the resolution of the octomap and cost map
